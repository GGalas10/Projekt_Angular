# Projekt Angular
This project is created solely for learning the Angular framework. 
As my hooby is soccer, hence the idea to create a web application that will collect information about soccer clubs and their personnel.
The project consists of two separate technologies. The first is a back-end developed in ASP.NET and the second front-end in Angular
